Namal Uyana is a natural park in Sri Lanka.
It has been designated as a unique conservation area due to its historical significance, biodiversity and geographical features.
Due to this the National Namal Uyana has become an attractive oasis for tourists.
Na Park Na flowers are most fragrant and last from April to June.
At the Period of Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura there were not any Na trees.
At that time, it was a Residential treatment center.
As a treatment of Rehabilitation penology na trees were planted by people who were in rehabilitation.
To enter the Namal Uyana in the Galkiriyagama area in the Kekirawa Division, take the Adiyagala Road in Galkiriyagama Village, 7 km from the Madatugama Junction on the ColomboAnuradhapura Expressway.
There are two major importance of the Namal National Park.
Ceylon ironwood Na trees cover 260 acres of land in the area Mount Rose Thiruvana a pink quartz spread over an area of 500 million years.
Mount Rose Thiruvana is made up of 7 ridges and is the largest Pink Quartz Range in South Asia.
Ceylon ironwood trees with large, branched Ceylon ironwood Na stems can be seen more than the Ceylon ironwood species seen in the normal environment, and their leaves are reddish in color at the leaf stage and shiny dark green at maturity.
The largest Ceylon ironwood Na tree in Sri Lanka, about 60 feet in circumference, can also be seen in this forest.
Unawatuna Maha Vidyalaya is a public government school in Unawatuna.
The school has a history of more than 100 years.
Nowadays, schools have more than a thousand students at school.
Since school started, there are 21 principals working here.
It was a short film which showcased incidents like the victory of the British in the Boer War, the funeral of Queen Elizabeth and the coronation of Edward VII.
The cinema gained popularity in Sri Lanka when an Englishman, Weswick Major, introduced bioscope shows.
These films were screened in open spaces in temporary tents.
Since this company became very successful after screening Indian films, its rival, Olympia company, built more movie theatres in the country.
In 1925, the film named, Rajakeeya Wickramaya, was produced in Sri Lanka for the first time.
Perera played the lead role in it and the film was screened in India and Singapore.
However, the film mysteriously disappeared during its screening in Singapore.
It uses that power to modify and reflect the signal with encoded data.
Antennas on other devices, in turn, detect that signal and can respond accordingly.
This approach would let mobile and other devices communicate without being turned on.
It would also allow unpowered sensors to communicate, allowing them to be placed in places where external power cannot be conveniently supplied.
The network is ad hoc because it does not rely on a preexisting infrastructure, such as routers in wired networks or access points in managed infrastructure wireless networks.
Instead, each node participates in routing by forwarding data for other nodes, so the determination of which nodes forward data is made dynamically on the basis of network connectivity.
In addition to the classic routing, ad hoc networks can use flooding for forwarding data.
These use independent variation of the speed of each rotor to achieve control.
By changing the speed of each rotor, it is possible to specifically generate a desired total thrust to locate for the center of thrust both laterally and longitudinally and to create a desired total torque or turning force.
Quadcopters differ from conventional helicopters which use rotors which are able to vary the pitch of their blades dynamically as they move around the rotor hub.
In the early days of flight, quadcopters then referred to as quadrotors were seen as possible solutions to some of the persistent problems in vertical flight torque induced control issues as well as efficiency issues originating from the tail rotor, which generates no useful lift can be eliminated by counterrotation and the relatively short blades are much easier to construct.
The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession for the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan.
His editor, Maxwell Perkins, felt the book was vague and persuaded the author to revise over the next winter.
Fitzgerald was repeatedly ambivalent about the book's title, and he considered a variety of alternatives, including titles that referenced the Roman character Trimalchio. The title he was last documented to have desired was Under the Red, White, and Blue.
However, the novel experienced a revival during World War II and became a part of American high school curricula and numerous stage and film adaptations in the following decades.
That era, known for unprecedented economic prosperity, the evolution of jazz music, flapper culture, and bootlegging and other criminal activity, is plausibly depicted in Fitzgeralds novel.
Tomography refers to imaging by sections or sectioning, through the use of any kind of penetrating wave.
The method is used in radiology, archaeology, biology, atmospheric science, geophysics, oceanography, plasma physics, materials science, astrophysics, quantum information, and other sciences.
In most cases it is based on the mathematical procedure called tomographic reconstruction.

Typically, bots perform tasks that are both simple and structurally repetitive, at a much higher rate than would be possible for a human alone.
Common examples including gaming bots, whereby a player achieves a significant advantage by implementing some repetitive routine with the use of a bot rather than manually, or auction site robots, where lastminute bid placing speed may determine who places the winning bid using a bot to place counterbids affords a significant advantage over bids placed manually.
Cranial nerves are the nerves that emerge directly from the brain including the brainstem, in contrast to spinal nerves which emerge from segments of the spinal cord.
Cranial nerves relay information between the brain and parts of the body, primarily to and from regions of the head and neck.
These factors can affect how a company operates, its costs, and the demand for its products.
Environmental factors include ecological and environmental aspects such as weather, climate, and climate change, which may especially affect industries such as tourism, farming, and insurance.
Furthermore, growing awareness of the potential impacts of climate change is affecting how companies operate and the products they offer, both creating new markets and diminishing or destroying existing ones.
Other factors for the various offshoots include.
Demographic factors include gender, age, ethnicity, knowledge of languages, disabilities, mobility, home ownership, employment status, religious belief or practice, culture and tradition, living standards and income level.
Regulatory factors include acts of parliament and associated regulations, international and national standards, local government bylaws, and mechanisms to monitor and ensure compliance with these.
The security environment may include either personal, company, or national security.
Other business related factors that might be considered in an environmental analysis include Competition, Demographics, Ecological, Geographical, Historical, Organizational, and Temporal schedule.
For example, consumer and B2B companies tend to be more affected by social factors, while a global defense contractor would tend to be more affected by political factors.
Additionally, factors that are more likely to change in the future or more relevant to a given company will carry greater importance.
For example, a company which has borrowed heavily will need to focus more on the economic factors, especially interest rates.
A facsimile of the original diary of Anne Frank on display in Berlin.
A diary sometimes referred to as journal or notebook is a record originally in handwritten format with discrete entries arranged by date reporting on what has happened over the course of a day or other period.
A personal diary may include a person's experiences, and thoughts or feelings, including comments on current events outside the writer's direct experience.
Someone who keeps a diary is known as a diarist.
Today the term is generally employed for personal diaries, normally intended to remain private or to have a limited circulation amongst friends or relatives.
The word journal may be sometimes used for diary, but generally a diary has or intends to have daily entries, whereas journal writing can be less frequent.
Although a diary may provide information for a memoir, autobiography or biography, it is generally written not with the intention of being published as it stands, but for the author's own use.
The National Forest Policy, aside from protecting the environment directly, advocates increased community involvement and unity in forest management, providing leases to the private sector to manage multiple use production forests.
The scope of the policy includes the biophysical, environmental, socio political and economic components of forestry in Sri Lanka.
The policy stressed the need to conserve biodiversity, soil and water resources and it emphasizes the central importance of retaining the present natural forest cover in sustaining an ecological balance in the ecosystems of the island.
Under the policy, the remaining natural forests are to be used sustainably to provide for the growing demand for bioenergy, wood and non-wood forest products.
The policy has also identified the need for collaboration to make sustainable forest management a reality, and has guided the state sector, farmers, NGOs and small and medium scale commercial entrepreneurs towards community organization in protecting the forests whilst meeting wood, raw material and the bioenergy requirements.
